# Infinite Scroll Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented infinite scrolling for the feed posts with the following features:

### âœ… What was implemented:

1. **Custom `useInfiniteScroll` Hook** - Efficient scroll handling without performance-heavy useEffects
2. **IntersectionObserver-based Loading** - No scroll event listeners for better performance
3. **Batched Rendering** - Initial batch of 5 posts, then 5 more per scroll
4. **Early Loading Trigger** - Loads next batch when user reaches 2nd-to-last item
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Optional component to track rendering performance
6. **Smooth Loading States** - Visual indicators and end-of-feed messaging

### ðŸ”§ Key Files Modified/Created:

- `hooks/useInfiniteScroll.ts` - Core infinite scroll logic
- `components/shared/InfiniteFeedPageLayout.tsx` - Layout with infinite scroll
- `components/shared/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Performance tracking
- `app/feed/page.tsx` - Updated to use infinite scroll layout
- `components/demo/InfiniteScrollDemo.tsx` - Demo component for testing

### ðŸš€ Performance Benefits:

- Renders only 5 posts initially instead of all posts
- Uses IntersectionObserver (more efficient than scroll events)
- Early loading prevents loading delays
- Reduced memory footprint in DOM
- Optimized state management with minimal useEffect dependencies

### ðŸ§ª Testing:

- Demo page available at `/demo/infinite-scroll`
- Fallback to original layout available via toggle
- Performance monitoring in development mode

The implementation provides smooth infinite scrolling while maintaining all existing feed functionality.
